# Van Gogh Map

Experiment with MapBox's new WebGL mapping library

HTML + JS

Doesn't work if your browser is IE or a potato.

## How it works

Several Van Gogh painting scans are available as textures

You select textures to make up the basemap

MapBox GL renders a new map based on your selected textures

## License

GPLv3+ deal with it
